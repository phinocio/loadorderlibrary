# v5.2.0
> 2021-11-02

## Fixed

# v5.1.3
> 2021-09-13

## Fixed
- Fixed `exires_at` not being set for backups in the `CreateBackup.php` file

# v5.1.2
> 2021-08-31

## Fixed
- Fixed accordians on the admin stats page to actually open/collapse

# v5.1.1
> 2021-08-22

# v5.1.0
> 2021-08-19

# v5.0.0
> 2021-08-12

	- Updated `laravel-mix` from `6.0.25` -> `6.0.27`

- Composer
	- Updated with `composer update`

# v4.3.1
> 2021-08-08

## Fixed
- Fixed long links breaking the site by being trimmed at 150 characters. Increased to 300 to hopefully prevent that

# v4.3.0
> 2021-07-22

## Added
- Added a user management area at `/admin/users` for the so I can verify accounts without having to manually edit the database
	- Said area will show me
		- User's names (it's public anyway)
		- True/false for if they have an email (there's literally 0 reason for me to actually see people's emails)
		- Total number of lists they have (including private, this will not provide me a link to any lists, just a number)
		- True/false for if they're verified
		- Created date (when they registered)
	- The above will give me some minor "anayltics" that don't require me using a 3rd party tool like Google Analytics or something

## Fixed
- Fixed bad import in `UserFactory.php`

## Changed
- Changed the name of a few routes to be more consistent and updated links to them
- Updated the stats page to indicate how many verified authors there is

# v4.2.0
> 2021-07-21

## Added
- Added a badge beside the name of verified accounts. Accounts can be verified by...asking me to do so. Though at the moment I only really plan to verify the accounts of
	- People I know/have interacted with (so I know their real accounts/can verify that their Load Order Library account is theirs)
	- Wabbajack list makers that meet the above (basically all of em lol) and want to be verified

	- Still on the fence of if letting verified users tag specific lists of theirs as "official" is useful or not. Please let me know if it is
- Added a migration to add an `is_verified` column to the `users` table
- Added a specific field for lists that have a website (suchs as TPF or Narsil)
- Added a few blade components for icons, to not clutter my main views with SVG while working on them
- Made the test user verified in the seeder

## Changed
- Changed color of the edit and download buttons to be secondary blue with white text
- Made it more clear what fields are optional on the upload and edit forms

# v4.1.2
> 2021-07-21

## Changed
- Added some bottom padding to the list filter on the My Lists and Browse pages
- Removed the redundant "Filter" label

# v4.1.1
> 2021-07-11

## Added
- Added a hover text to show the exact date/time that a list was updated/created at in UTC
- Added a number showing how many lists there are on the My Lists and Browse pages

# v4.1.0
> 2021-07-11

## Added
- Added a temporary filter to the browse lists (and my lists) page while I work on a better one. The next iteration of search will probably be a while and come with the switch to the in-progress React front-end

## Changed
- Changed both the My Lists page and the Browse page to no longer use pagination to make the filter easier. Hopefully this doesn't kill load times

# v4.0.3
> 2021-07-11

## Fixed
- Email field on registration page was accidentally marked as required, forcing the browser to do verification on it. Oops. Removed the required field
- Fixed the ordering of the title for embeds

> 2021-07-03

## Fixed

	- Updated compose packages by running `composer update`

# v4.0.1
> 2021-07-03

# v4.0.0
> 2021-06-26 - 2021-07-01

## Changed
- Updated to Bootstrap v5 and fixed breaking changes. Amount of changes are a bit too much to document everything in changelog. See diffs :)
- Changed the text of `Upload List`, `Browse Lists`, and `Compare Lists` to not have `List[s]` as I feel it's self-evident

## Removed
- Removed `guest.blade.php` as it was redundant

# v3.6.1
> 2021-06-26

## Added
- Added a simple stat to show me how many users do not have an email. To be explicit, it's literally just an integer count, emails aren't displayed anywhere except a user's own account page

# v3.6.0
> 2021-06-26

## Fixed
- Fixed the filter on comparison page breaking the layout when actually using it. Oop

# v3.5.1
> 2021-06-26

## Added
- Provided one knows the slug of a private list, they are able to compare it to another list (by manually pasting it in the URL). This is a stop-gap method of comparing until I implement being able to compare against another list directly from a list's page. Private lists still do not show up in the existing comparison selection page

# v3.5.0
> 2021-06-18

## Added
- Added a feature on account creation checking if a password has been seen in a breach, using the Have I Been Pwned? API

> 2021-03-05

## Added

- Added stat to admin stats page to show size of all `tmp` files
- Added artisan command `tmp:clear` to clear the `app/storage/tmp` directory
- Added task to run `tmp:clear` every 24h

# v1.8.0
> 2021-03-05

## Added
- Added download buttons for downloading individual file from a list, or all files in a list
- Added `DownloadController` to handle downloading of files
- Added `/lists/{load_order:slug}/download/{file}` route to `web.php` to handle file downloading
- `DownloadController` handles leting the user download a single file or all of them together depending on if the `{file}` sent is `all` or a specific file

## Changed
- Changed `Delete` text for deleting a list to be more explicit: `Delete List`
- Changed display of `Delete List` button to be `btn-outline`


# v1.7.2
> 2021-03-05

## Added
- Added version info to `config/app.php` and `package.json`

# v1.7.1
> 2021-03-05

## Added
- Added an indicator of if a list is private or not to the `My Lists` page and the direct list view

## Changed
- Changed list view page to show 2 per line as 3 felt a bit squished

# v1.7.0
> 2021-03-05

## Fixed
- Fixed `show disabled` function only toggling the *first* disabled item in modlist.txt. Toggling now works as intended

# v1.6.3
> 2021-03-05

## Changed
- Moved all testing files to a git ignored `test-files` folder so clean up repo a bit

# v1.6.2
> 2021-03-05

## Fixed
- Fixed regex again

# v1.6.1
> 2021-03-05

## Fixed
- Fixed a bad regex to find all line break characters and replace them with `\n`. All uploaded files should now be converted to LF on upload as intended

# v1.6.0
> 2021-03-04

## Added
- Added TODO entry to implement a much more robust solution to line endings

## Fixed
- Fixed issues with comparing plugins.txt by just removing `*` from the file before compare (doesn't touch the file on disk)

## Closed
- https://github.com/phinocio/loadorderlibrary/issues/37

# v1.5.0
> 2021-03-04

## Changed
- Changed comparison page to be "disabled" with a note I found an issue and am working on it

# v1.3.5
> 20201-03-02

	- Added `fruitcake/laravel-cors`. Apparently it's required. Oops

# v1.3.4
> 2021-03-02

## Fixed
- Fixed display of counter in list view on phones (I hope, only have so many to test on)
- Fixed display of files in general on mobile. Compare results page still looks bad-ish, but it's good enough for now and not a priority

## Changed
- Changed subheading `Updates` to `Internals`
- Moved both the list filter input and the `show disabled` switch into the file collapse itself as they're only needed when viewing a specific file
- Changed the &#11166; arrow on files to a bold `+` since phones weren't displaying it

## Internals
- NPM
	- Added `browser-sync`
	- Added `browser-sync-webpack-plugin`
- Composer

	- Updated `laravel/framework` from `v8.29.0` -> `v8.30.0`
	- Updated `laravel/tinker` from `v2.6.0` -> `v2.6.1`

# v1.3.3
> 2021-03-01

## Added
- Added `Differences` and `No Differences` badge to files on comparison results for a quick glance at what is different

## Fixed

## Changed

- Change comparison results page to show all files that are in both lists
- Changed card footer note on comparison results page to match now showing all files that are in both lists

# v1.3.2
> 2021-03-01

## Fixed

- Fixed compare page list of lists looking ugly
- Fixed removing first letter of a plugin name if plugins in `plugins.txt` do not start with `*`

## Changed
- Changed filter to use `remove()` and `add()` `classList` methods so I don't need to use the wrapping `<span>` hack
- Changed all `list-group-item-dark` to `list-group item list-group-item-dark` as that's what it's meant to be. Oops
- Changed file name display on compare results page to be the same as list view
- Changed the hover BG color for list items to be lighter as it was matching the BG on other pages

## Removed
- Removed leftover debugging `console.log` in `view-load-order.blade.php`
- Removed wrapping `<span>` around each list item in `view-load-order.blade.php`
- Removed hacky if statement to apply `list-group-item-dark` or `list-group-item-dark-odd` classes on list items in `view-load-order.blade.php`
- Removed `.list-group-item-dark-odd` class

# v1.3.1
> 2021-02-28

## Fixed
- Fixed separators not being parsed properly by changing `trim()` to `str_replace()`

# v1.3.0
> 2021-02-28

## Added
- Added IDEAS.md for ideas that may or may not becom actual features
- Added the removal of the `automatically generated` text that is present in certain files. The text still exists in the files themselves as I don't want to touch those, this is simply for display purposes
- Added parsing of `modlist.txt` file in `LoadOrderController::show` to determine if a line is disabled or a separator and not use JS in front-end. Disabled mods in `modlist.txt` start hidden, with a toggle to view them
- Added `.list-separator` and `.list-disabled` classes to style separators differently than the other items
- Added a parent `<span>` around each `<li>` on `view-load-order.blade.php` for purposes of filtering and keeping classes. Bad fix, but eventual re-write will make it better
- Added flex related settings to `.counter` to prevent bad looking spaces showing for lines that are too tall
- Added a `list-group-item-dark-odd` class to alternate background because I'm too lazy to figure out a better method when I'm going to re-write anyway
- Added a button to toggle hidden `modlist.txt` mods and accompanying JS to `view-load-order.blade.php` for it
- Added an indicator that the file names are dropdowns

## Fixed
- Fixed typo of `insatances` to correct `instances` in [v1.2.1](#v121)

## Changed
- Changed `modlist.txt`, `loadorder.txt` and `plugins.txt` to reflect a more complex list for testing (TPF 4.3.2)
- `view-load-order.blade.php` no longer does the logic of converting the txt of a file into an array, that is now done in `LoadOrderController::show` method
- Changed top and bottom padding of `.counter` to 5 so each entry doesn't feel so big
- Changed all `lo-list-item` classes to `list-group-item-dark` across multiple files to be more consistent
- Cleaned up classes in `app.scss` to be more consistent
- By changing to `list-group-item-dark`, lines are now more compact to view
- Changed filter on `view-load-order.blade.php` to work somewhat better by not removing classes on elements but dealing with a parent `<span>`

## Removed
- Removed `lo-list` and `lo-list-item` classes

# v1.2.8

## Added
